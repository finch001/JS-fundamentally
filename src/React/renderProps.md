## Render Props

A component with a render prop takes a function that returns a React element and calls it instead of implementing its own render logic.

Components are the primary unit of code reuse in React, but it’s not always obvious how to share the state or behavior that one component encapsulates to other components that need that same state.

- Reusable logic — by separating view from logic, we don’t have to marry our logic to any one component or visual representation.
- Clean and easy to read JSX.
- Facilitates component composition and functional composition in your React Apps.
